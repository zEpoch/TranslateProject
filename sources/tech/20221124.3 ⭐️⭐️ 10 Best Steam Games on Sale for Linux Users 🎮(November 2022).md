10 Best Steam Games on Sale for Linux Users 🎮(November 2022)
======

[Gaming on Linux][1] has been evolving over the years, thanks to Steam's **Proton** and Wine and many other tools like **Bottles, Lutris, and Heroic Game Launcher**.

This means even if a game is unavailable natively on Linux, you can still play some of them thanks to [Steam Play][2].

That's great. Now, you would need some great discounts on games to give them a try, right?

Well, you are in luck; the yearly **Steam Autumn Sale** is live right now (until **29th November**), with offers on much of the catalog.

I have picked a few games for Linux systems (even if they are not officially supported) that might pique your interest.
