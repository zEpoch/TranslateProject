How to Install Flatpak Apps in Ubuntu and Other Linux
======

**A beginner’s guide on how to install Flatpak in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions.**

### What is Flatpak?

[Flatpak][1] is the new way of distributing apps across the Linux universe, irrespective of the distribution. This cross-distro application distribution and deployment framework enable developers to Flatpak setup for apps for all major distributions.

The major hurdles in any Linux app distribution are dependencies, and Flatpak covers that. Flatpak builds bundles the dependencies for the respective apps, and end-users need not worry about it.

With the growing trends, many app developers are now providing the Flatpak builds along with traditional packages, e.g. *.deb, etc. With a quick setup for your distributions, you can be ready to explore the world of Flatpak apps. All the major Flatpak apps are available on flathub.org. You can search and just click a button, you can install the Flatpak apps. Here’s how to set it up for Ubuntu and other Linux distributions.

### How to setup Flatpak in Ubuntu

- For Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish), use the following command to install Flatpak (that includes Ubuntu 22.04 as well).

```
sudo apt install flatpak
```

If you are using an older version of Ubuntu, use the following repo.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/flatpak
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flatpak
```

- The second step is optional if you want to install Flatpak apps via the browser. Enable Ubuntu Software to recognize Flatpak apps and their installations. Run the below commands from the terminal and provide the password when prompted.

```
sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
```

- Add the Flathub repository where all the Flatpak apps reside. Run the below commands from the terminal.

```
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

- Reboot.

### Install in Other Linux Distributions

Once installation is completed, and reboot is done, you can proceed with installing some cool Flatpak apps via the below steps.

### How to Install Flatpak Apps in Ubuntu and Other Linux

There are two ways you can install Flatpak apps. Firstly via the command line, which I recommend. And second is the browser method.

I recommend using the command line because it is faster and easier.

#### Using the command line (recommended)

The sample command to install any Flatpak app is available at the bottom section of the Flathub app page. A sample command is below:

```
flatpak install org.gimp.GIMP
```

Change the above “org.gimp.GIMP” for your application. Remember, this is case-sensitive.

#### Using the graphical method via browser

- Go to [Flathub][3].
- Search for any apps you want to install.

![][4]

- Click install after selecting your desired app.

![Install Flatpak][5]

- Click Ok when it prompts you to start the installation via Software.

![Open Flatpackref via Software][6]

- The Software will open and wait till the installation finishes.

### How to update Flatpak after you install them?

Updating Flatpak is super easy via the terminal. For example, if you want to update the above GIMP package, you need to run the below command.

```
flatpak update org.gimp.GIMP
```

So, this will update a single package. Replace your package’s name (i.e. Application ID) for your use case. If you don’t know the Application ID, run the command `flatpak list` from the terminal, and you will find it.

If you want to update ALL the Flatpak packages in your system, simply run the following:

```
flatpak update
```

### How to uninstall a Flatpak?

You can uninstall a package using the following command. Make sure to change the Application ID for your use case. You can find out the Application ID from the command `flatpak list`.

```
flatpak remove org.gimp.GIMP
```

### Closing Notes

In this tutorial, I have explained how you can easily set up Flatpak and install apps from Flathub. Moreover, Flatpak applications are a great way to install and manage them easily. In my opinion, Flatpak will eventually dominate Snap and AppImage in the future.
