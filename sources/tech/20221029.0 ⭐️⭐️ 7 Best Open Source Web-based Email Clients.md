7 Best Open Source Web-based Email Clients
======

Email services are here to stay, even if decentralized tech takes over the internet.

However, with big tech trying to control everything new aspect of emerging technologies, how can you take charge of your email service?

Whether a business/enterprise or an individual, a self-hosted open-source webmail service is always an option worth considering. Your server, your digital infrastructure, and your email service platform. This way, you do not have to rely on a vendor or a third party to manage your email services. You do it your way.

### Why Should You Self-Host an Email Service?

![best opensource web based email clients 1][1]

It is **not a one-click process** to self-host a service, which you can use as a web-based email client or sync with an email app.

So, why bother? Can’t you use some of the [best privacy-focused email services][2] like [Proton Mail][3] and Tutanota?

Well, yes, you can.

But, for businesses and enterprises, some advantages of self-hosting webmail include:

- **The user gets total control over email data.**
- **You get the ability to build your infrastructure that meets the requirements of your email services.**
- **It provides scalability for individuals, small businesses, and enterprises.**
- **You can create unlimited email accounts and email aliases.**
- **Users can easily apply advanced filters and other protection mechanisms without paying for a subscription.**

Here, I list some of the best options that you can pick.

### 1. Roundcube

Roundcube is a popular PHP-based webmail software that provides all the essential features in a simple user interface.

With most of the server hosting providers, you already get it pre-installed. You have to configure it for your domain or create email accounts to get started.

You can also install it and customize it on your server.

A classic PHP-based with IMAP and SMTP protocol support. It does not include many features, but it gets the basics right if you want lightweight and stable webmail software to host.

### Interesting Mentions

Several open-source projects are under active development that you can experiment with.

Of course, we do not recommend using them for business or personal use. You can try them out to see if you want to contribute to their development in some way.

I would like to mention a couple of such mail service projects.

#### Mailpile

While it deserves a spot in the list above, the development for [Mailpile][19] has halted until Python3 rewrite is complete.

![mailpile][20]

It is a fast and modern open-source webmail with encryption and privacy-centric features.

#### Cuttlefish

![cuttlefish][21]

[Cuttlefish][22] is a free and open-source transactional email service. It aims to be an alternative to proprietary services like [SendGrid][23].

It is in its early stages of development.

#### Pinbox

A self-hosted webmail solution that gets its inspiration from Google Inbox.

[Pinbox][24] a work in progress and needs a few prerequisites to make it work.

### Wrapping Up

Squirrelmail, Horde, and Roundcube remain of the most popular options that can be easily accessed with most hosting providers.

Of course, these options are not always modern looking or have features like Google Workspace or even Zoho but you get enough to do the necessary emailing.
