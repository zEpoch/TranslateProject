10 Best Open Source Bots for Your Discord Server
======

Discord started as a platform where gamers and friends could hang out. **[Discord][1] has over 150 million users** in **2022**, even after [turning down][2] a **$12 billion offer from Microsoft**.

If it is your first time hearing about it, consider it something like Slack, but with countless fun functionalities to create communities (i.e., servers).

Among all the features, Discord bots allow automating things or spice up your server. But most of them are proprietary. So, in this list, I suggest some of the **best open-source Discord bots**.

**Note:**Bots can spread malware and affect your entire Discord server. You must ensure that you do not add bots you do not know about. And this is why you might want to trust open-source Discord bots more than other options.

### 1. MonitoRSS

Highlights:

- **RSS Feed**
- **Filters and Subscriptions**
- **Hosted**

[MonitoRSS][4] is a useful Discord bot that enables your community to receive news from any sources that support RSS.

It is a reasonably popular bot that works as expected. You can add it to a particular channel, customize its look, and start getting news updates on your Discord server.

It also lets you filter articles for your feed and allow users to subscribe to an article as per their liking. This can be managed and customized using a web interface control panel.

Explore more on its [GitHub page][5].

### 2. ModMail

![modmail discord][6]

Highlights:

- **Enables users to contact server staff**
- **Self-host**
- **Hosted version**
- **Optional premium**

[ModMail][7] is a simple open-source Discord bot that seamlessly lets a user contact the staff/admins/moderators of a Discord channel.

Traditionally, you have to reach out to multiple people via DMs to expect help on something you want to know. However, some servers have many users, so it may be difficult for the server staff to get back to you.

ModMail creates a separate channel when you send a message to the bot. And this channel acts as a shared inbox to all the administrators, mods, and you.

Not only does easy messaging, but it also helps the server staff to conveniently read past transcripts, enable automated replies, save snippets of them, respond anonymously, and more. Some features are premium-only.

You can check out its [official website][9] and [GitHub page][10] for more info. It also gives you all the necessary information to self-host it.

### 3. Red Discord Bot (Self-Hosted)

[Red][12] is an entirely modular bot that provides you with many functions, including music, moderation, trivia, stream alerts, and more.

Red should be useful whether you want it to send welcome messages or help moderate the server.

Unlike some others, you cannot add the bot directly to your server. You will have to self-host it, configure it, and then get the ability to add it to your server.

The installation does not need any sort of coding; you have to follow the [documentation][13].
